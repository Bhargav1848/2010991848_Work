1. Computing Paradigms==> Essential Characterstics + Service Models + Deployment Models
2. Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous(used anywhere),convenient,on-demand network access to
   a shared pool configurable computing resources.
2.5 Servers+(Virutalization or ParaVirtualization) will lead to cloud computing.
3. Private Deployment: 
        Advantages:
            1.Complete Control.
            2.Move
            3.Deploy anything
            4.Scale It Up
        Disadvantages:
            1.Fully Unmanaged (Difficult To Manage)
            2.Humar Reaource to manage
            3.TroubleShooting
        Capital Expenditure: Expenditure held for setup of servers.
        Operational Expenditure:On going Expenditure.
4. Public Deployment: Third party setup
                      Ex: AWS,Google,Azure
5. Hybrid Deployment: Mixture of Public and Private Deployment.
6. Communitiy Deployment:Similar to Private one will host and rest of the communitiy can use.

1. On Premises:
2. Infrastructure (as service) IaaS => Full Administrative
3. Platform (as a service) PaaS => Limited Administrative
4. Software (as a service) SaaS  =>  Unsage and Usage related services

-- Virutalization: We download one iso file which helps us install new type OS
-- Para Virutalization: Reframe the Kernel so that it can support Virutalization.

1 Virtual Machine: Its is a closely detached software device that could run its own os and application 
as if it is running on a physical machine;
2. Hypervisor: minimal kerlnel to run OS
3
4. Hosted Virutalization: A method
